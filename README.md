## Local Setup and Installation

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
-   npm (or yarn)
-   A MongoDB database instance (local or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Priyanshubasu0902/MedEasy.git

```

### 2. Backend Setup

1.  Navigate to the server directory:
    ```sh
    cd server
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following environment variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.
    ```env
    # Server Configuration
    PORT=5000
    
    # MongoDB Connection
    MONGODB_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
    
    # JWT
    JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret_key>
    
    # Cloudinary for file uploads
    CLOUDINARY_NAME=<your_cloudinary_cloud_name>
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<your_cloudinary_api_key>
    CLOUDINARY_SECRET_KEY=<your_cloudinary_api_secret_key>
    
    # Nodemailer for sending emails (using Gmail)
    EMAIL_ID=<your_gmail_address>
    EMAIL_PASSWORD=<your_gmail_app_password>
    ```
4.  Start the backend server:
    ```sh
    npm run server
    ```
    The server will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 3. Frontend Setup

1.  Navigate to the client directory from the root folder:
    ```sh
    cd client
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory and add the backend URL:
    ```env
    VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
    ```
4.  Start the frontend development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port specified by Vite).
